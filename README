Test assignment for web developer job vacancy at Gamind. They require to complete it in C, Erlang, Ruby, Python, JavaScript, HTML and ActionScript. So I did it just to show that I know all these languages, I bash and despise.

I haven't generated HTML pagination automatically, because it is a pain in the ass to escape special symbols in JavaScript.

See Gaminid Test (WEB).pdf for detail.
